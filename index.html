        <h1>What is aug?</h1>
        <p>
          aug keeps track of the songs you listen to online, and creates a
          'mosaic' dashboard of each release's album artwork. you can hover
          over each release to reveal more info about the songs you've listened
          to.
        </p>
        <p>
          aug can recognize songs from just about any online music source.
          whatever the song, whatever the source, aug remembers for you... all
          in one place.
        </p>

        <h2>See what you hear.</h2>
        <p>
          aug's main dashboard is a simple mosaic of all the releases you've
          listened to online. hover over any release to see which tracks you
          heard from that release, when, how many times, at which site(s) and
          for how long.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>[expanded per-release detail: which tracks {tracks detented to top of list]; equal width progress bars with timestamp at the end; filled in with percentage of the track listened to {maybe in pink} and a listened-to timestamp. maybe repeat this view as a close up with a caption explaining "the time stamp helps you identify whether you listened to auditions at an online store, or the entire song at a streaming site."]</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          you can configure aug however you want. organize your mosaic by when,
          where or how often you listen online.

        <h2>Easily explore more songs, releases & artists</h2>
        <p>
          when you hear something you like, aug makes it easier than ever to
          explore the release and the artist. aug can automatically link you to
          the full album release for that song, at your choice of streaming
          sites or online music stores. when you visit those sites, aug can
          keep track of which songs you've already heard and which ones may be
          new to you, right in the external site.

        <h2>Curate your auditions.</h2>
        <p>
          like to 'try before you buy?' aug can curate playlists at online
          stores to prioritize songs you haven't heard yet, or even remove the
          songs you've already heard. when you visit the most popular online
          DJ stores like Juno, Beatport, Bleep or Clone, aug can flag tracks
          you've already heard as visited links, so you can focus on the new
          stuff.

        <h2>Break up with the songs you hate!</h2>
        <p>
          You've heard that song enough to last you a lifetime. Everybody else
          seems to love it (why?!), but guess what... you HATE it. Want to stop
          hearing it?</p>
        <p>You can ghost songs, releases or even artists, which will
          automatically skip them in any online playlist, no matter the site or
          app. Your exes will still display, so you can easily unghost them
          with one click. Or you can unghost once, to check if they've changed
          their ways before you get back together.
        </p>

          <em>[maybe a ghost dialog: "Ghosting will skip [track name] audio in all playlists. You will still see [track name] listed, and can unghost once or permanently anytime. Continue?" 'Yes/ No' buttons; 'Don't warn me again' checkbox]</em>

        <h2>aug isn't just for online music stores... it's for the whole web.</h2>
        <p>
          aug works on free streaming sites too. soundcloud, youtube, spotify
          free or premium... all are compatible with aug. if the song can be
          identified by popular song recognition apps like shazam or soundhound,
          it will be recognized by aug.
        </p>
        both the app and the browser plug-in recognize everything you listen to
        online, regardless of whether you listen in a proprietary app or a
        different browser.

        <h2>Your audio, your privacy.</h2>
        <p>
          aug never sells your individual data or shares it with any external
          companies. we do share aggregate data with others, including you,
          about the most popular songs among all of aug's users on our Charts.
